Class names - CamelCase

Class methods = lowerCamelCase

Class variables = lowerCamelCase

functions = underscore_to_seperate_words

Symbolic constants (ANY 'magic number') = ALL_CAPS_UNDERSCORE

Functions should be pure. That means they should be deterministic and not keep
state. Random numbers are obviously an exception.

Objects in the geometry.py file and the source.py file are not to keep any state beyond init.

Units:
    - Length in mm
    - Time in ns
