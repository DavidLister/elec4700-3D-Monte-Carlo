# LIDAR-Sim

## Todo list:
    - Speed up multithreading
    - Look into mouse issues on windows
    - Fix up separation between visualization and main. Import common scene file?
    - Visualize paths and make sure reflections work properly
    - Specular vs diffuse reflections
    - Make simulation trigger from visualization
    - Remote server thread pools
